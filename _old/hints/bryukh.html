    <div class="answer">
        You need to check all of the horizontals, verticals and diagonals.
        If any of them contains three equal symbols (exclude "."), then this symbol wins.

        It's easy to check the horizontals:
            <pre class="brush: python">
for row in field:
    if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] and row[0] != ".":
        bla bla
        </pre>

        To check the verticals you can rotate a matrix with this trick:
        <pre class="brush: python">
rotated_field = zip(*field)</pre>

        For diagonals you can check with hard-code (field[0][0]&nbsp;==&nbsp;field[1][1]&nbsp;==&nbsp;...).
